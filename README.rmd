### Spectral sensor Interface

This package provides an interface to the AS7265x spectral sensor, which is a low-cost chipset that provides 18-channel readings of the intensity of light at wavelenghts ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. This package communicates with the sensor with AT commands through the UART interface. This requires the I2C interface to be disabled and UART to be enabled, which can be accomplished by disconnecting some jumpers and connecting others. 


### Installation

```{r,eval=FALSE} 
# Development version 
devtools::install_github("pdhoff/SSI")   
```


### Basic usage

```{r,eval=FALSE} 
library(SSI) 
getSpecMat(plot=TRUE)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(SSI) 
S<-readRDS("testColors.rds")   
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(3,3,1,1),mgp=c(1.75,.75,0)) 
for(j in 1:3){ plotSpec(S[j,,"white"]) }
```
